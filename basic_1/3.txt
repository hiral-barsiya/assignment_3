3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Object-Oriented Programming and Procedural-Oriented Programming  are two fundamental programming paradigms. Here's a difference:


Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP):


1. Focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.
2. Data and functions are separate entities.
3. Data is shared among procedures through parameters or global variables.
4. Emphasizes step-by-step processing.
5. No encapsulation or data hiding.
6. Functions can modify data directly.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):


1. Focuses on objects that contain data and associated methods.
2. Data and methods are bundled together.
3. Data is hidden and accessed through methods.
4. Emphasizes modularity, reusability, and scalability.
5. Supports inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.
